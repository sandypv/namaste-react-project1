GIT commands:

After the git init command is used, a .git folder is created in the directory with some subdirectories.

> git add (or) In the vscode add " + " beside the file

-- to add files to the staging area.
-- before running the commit command, "git add" is used to add any new or modified files.

> git commit -m "commit message"

-- The commit command makes sure that the changes are saved to the local repository.

> git status 

-- The git status command tells the current state of the repository.
-- The command provides the current working branch. If the files are in the staging area, but not committed, it will be shown by the git status. Also, if there are no changes, it will show the message no changes to commit, working directory clean.

> git config --global user.name "any user name"
> git config --global user.email <email-id>

-- The git config command is used initially to configure the user.name and user.email. This specifies what email id and username will be used from a local repository.

-- When git config is used with --global flag, it writes the settings to all repositories on the computer.

> git branch

-- The git branch command is used to determine what branch the local repository is on.

> git branch <branch_name> -- # Create a new branch
> git branch -a -- # List all remote or local branches
> git branch -d <branch_name> -- # Delete a branch

> git checkout

-- The git checkout command is used to switch branches, whenever the work is to be started on a different branch.

> git checkout <branch_name> -- # Checkout an existing branch
> git checkout -b <new_branch> -- # Checkout and create a new branch with that name

>  git merge <branch_name> 

-- The git merge command is used to integrate the branches together. The command combines the changes from one branch to another branch.
